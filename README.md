# 👋 Hi, I'm Khristian Novoa!
![Simba](https://media3.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExNHRpZTUyODVjaGlka280ejF5czhnbWk0em14cThzbng0bWJsdnN0ZiZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/Lp71UWmAAeJHi/giphy.gif)

I’m a job-endorsed Data Analytics graduate from Turing College with hands-on experience in SQL, Python (logistic regression), Power BI, and Excel. I specialize in turning raw data into actionable insights through cohort analysis, A/B testing, customer segmentation (RFM, CLV), and predictive modeling.

My journey into analytics is shaped by a background in law enforcement, security, and trauma-informed youth advocacy. In these roles, I developed a high level of attention to detail, composure under pressure, and a structured, human-centered approach to solving problems—all of which now inform how I approach data.

Some of my recent projects include:
	•	Predicting 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk using logistic regression
	•	Evaluating marketing campaigns using SQL-based A/B testing and hypothesis testing
	•	Conducting RFM analysis to segment customer value and support retention strategies

I’m passionate about using data to improve processes, support decision-making, and uncover meaningful trends. I thrive in environments that value integrity, collaboration, and continuous learning.
